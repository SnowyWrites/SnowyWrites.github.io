                                        <h2>The Flyuverse?</h2>
                                        <h3>The Flyuverse was originally the brainchild of <a href="">CricketSounds</a>, a bot creator on <a href="">Janitorai.com</a> 
                                            and has since expanded out into a collaborative multi-media creative project with a handful of contributors.
                                            Content is primarily centered around AI chatbots, but later grew to include other forms of media.</br>
                                            The Extended Flyuverse is the unbrella under which other creators, like myself, contribute, and it includes
                                            fan content, lore contributers, artists, writers, etc, both canon and non-canon. Here, you'll find info on the 
                                            contributions I've made, including characters, lore, and even other forms of media!</h3>
                                        <p>Content advisory: A large amount of content within the Flyuverse is adult oriented and includes sexual content not fit for anyone
                                            under the age of 18. It should also be noted that Janitorai.com is an age restricted site. Minors DNI. It's bad for you. Go outside.

                                        <h2>Who are the Flyu?</h2>
                                        <h3>The Flyu are a colonizing race of aliens characterized by their blue skin, large stature, and long ears. In 2025, the Flyu Empire invaded Earth
                                            and enslaved humanity. Presently, in the year 5989, Earth has long since been destroyed and humans are domesticated, used for various purposes, 
                                            mostly kept as pets.</h3></br>

                                                    girlfriend and is still trying to figure out if he even wants to try another relationship.</p>

                                                    is a respected military officer while her mother, DH8, owns a shop for exotic flora. Her older brother, DS9, is a stunt pilot 
                                                    and has a successful HOLIVE show about it. She's loved humans since she was old enough to toddle up to them and give them treats, 
                                                    much to her mother's dismay, but oddly enough she never actually owned one before, despite begging her parents repeatedly. In 
                                                    school, she couldn't make up her mind what to study, going back and forth between human doctor, human appraiser, Earth Historian, 
                                                    and yoga instructor. Eventually, she just dropped out and helped at her mother's shop for a while before finding a job opening at 
                                                    Human Haven Adoption Center. She applied and was hired, to her joy, and has worked there ever since, moving from a filing clerk, 
                                                    to conducting the adoption vetting process.</p>

                                                    a strong interest in science from a young age, but often took his curiosity and experimentation too far. He sailed through 
                                                    schooling as a top student, and became a rising star among the Imperial scientific community. Unfortunately, his fringe ideas 
                                                    and lack of regard for ethical and safety regulations constantly got him into trouble, and eventually his 'human pituitary nanite 
                                                    engineering' experiments got him 'asked to step down and leave. Permanently.' After a dramatic exit, he and his assistant Mason 
                                                    set up shop in his new lair.</p>

                                                    parents both worked, and they had a human at home to keep him company. As he grew, he became wildly interested in human history 
                                                    and ancient Earth cultures, particularly European ones, and he devoured every scrap of information he could find. He also excelled 
                                                    greatly in mechanical engineering and was always tinkering with something in attempt to figure out how it worked or 'improve it', 
                                                    sometimes to his family's dismay. When he reached working age, he went to work as an engineer for the empire, but was always getting 
                                                    in trouble for making unapproved 'improvements' to various systems, ships, or devices. By sheer luck, he was invited to a Gala where 
                                                    a few members of the royal family were also in attendance, and it was there he met Stella and fell in love with her. The two had a 
                                                    secret affair for a number of months before it was discovered and AL37 was fired on the spot. He spent months afterwards saving his 
                                                    UBI to buy and fix up a space ship, which he dubbed The Valkyrie. Using his own designs and programmed systems, he created the fastest 
                                                    stealth ship in the universe, and used it to 'kidnap' Stella. After spending some time in hiding, he came up with the idea of finding 
                                                    a new planet for humans to live on. Stella agreed and they spent several years searching the universe for a planet that was both similar 
                                                    to what Earth had been, and far away enough from the Flyu Empire to be safe. Eventually hey found an undiscovered planet that AL37 
                                                    named "Gaia." He built a shelter for humans there, some planetary defenses, and he and Stella began their human kidnapping spree as 
                                                    The Esteemed Burglars, Starling and Crow.</p>

                                                    was young and grew up an orphan. His growth was stunted due to malnutrition. Became very jaded from an early age. Joined the military, 
                                                    but quit as soon as he could due to a growing distaste for the empire and it's favoritism, instead opting to go into law enforcement.

                                                    Was officially named HS0 by the Empire due to having no family and a mystery lineage, but he quickly changed it to Riff. He 
                                                    grew up jury-rigging scrap to survive. He got into smuggling because it was easy money. His first ship was won in a card game.

                                                    price on his head by several crime syndicates and the Empire. He's unaffiliated with any one party and works only for himself, 
                                                    but will do smuggling job for the right price.</p>

                                                    and her father, JX76, who is a high ranked military officer and gone a great deal of the time. She began singing at a young 
                                                    age and displayed a lot of natural talent, eventually being scouted by MS99 to perform professionally and build a career as

                                                <p>The 'textile moth' (fabricus devourus) is a small winged moth that, while harmless, detects and swarms any kind of textile material it finds and devours it. Natural or 
                                                    synthetic, fabric of any kind is a target for these little pests! Don't worry, they are not aggressive, and do not typically eat hair or bite skin, but these buggers
                                                    are the reason for Colony 8008's unique clothing and textile policies. Attempts by the Empire to exterminate them have been laregly unsuccessful due to the moth's rapid 
                                                    reproductive cycle and bizarre resistance to pesticides. To ensure minimal risk, please keep in mind these safety guidelines:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Any and all fabric materials must be strictly contained, or left off planet! The moth's are able to detect these materials from miles away and will swarm if they 
                                                            find a meal! </li>
                                                        <li>Leave hair loose! The moth's don't usually eat hair, but sometimes, if it's woven or braided, they might mistake it for fabric. </li>
                                                        <li>It may be tempting to try replacing fabrics with other types of apparel such as plastics or metals. Don't! Metal is simply too impractical for the climate, severely 
                                                            increasing risk of heat related illnesses. Plastics are, unfortunately, not immune to the planet's unique ecosystem either. Small microorganisms in the water are
